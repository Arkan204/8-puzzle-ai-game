## 🎮 Features
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, wood-themed interface built with Tkinter.
- **AI Auto-Solver**: Uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to solve any solvable puzzle optimally.
- **Smart Logic**: Ensures every randomized board is solvable.
- **Step Counter**: Tracks both user moves and AI solution steps.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arkan204/8-puzzle-ai-game.git
    ```
3.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd 8-puzzle-ai-game
    ```
4.  Run the game:
    ```bash
    python puzzle_game.py
    ```

## 🧠 How It Works
The game uses the **A* (A-Star) algorithm** with the Manhattan Distance heuristic to find the shortest path to the solution state `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, Empty]`.

Enjoy playing!
